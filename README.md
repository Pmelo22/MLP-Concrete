# MLP-Concrete

This repository contains an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) neural network project for analyzing the compressive strength of concrete. It uses the **Concrete Compressive Strength** dataset to train and evaluate a model capable of predicting whether a given concrete mixture is suitable for a specific construction.

> **Note:** This project was developed as part of a university assignment in the **Smart Systems** course. Despite being an academic work, it demonstrates my development skills, as it was completed in less than 5 hours.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- **Python** installed on your machine.
- The following libraries:

```python
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

## Recommendation
Although it is possible to run the project locally, **I recommend using Google Colab** to simplify execution, as it comes pre-installed with many libraries and allows the use of GPUs for faster neural network training.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pmelo22/mlp-concrete.git
   cd mlp-concrete
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not using Colab):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the main script (`mlp_concrete.py`) or open the Jupyter/Colab notebook to execute the code step by step.

## Project Objective
The goal is to build and train an MLP neural network to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its physicochemical properties. This can be useful for engineers and researchers who want to evaluate the feasibility of different concrete mixtures before real-world application.
